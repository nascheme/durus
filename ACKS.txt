Durus was inspired by ZODB and ZEO, the database and client/server
code produced by our friends at Zope, Inc.  Like ZODB, Durus
implements a pickle storage system and manages instances of a
Persistent class in a transactional way.  Like ZEO, Durus supports
access to a shared storage from connections in multiple processes.

The code of Durus shares some small fragments and some names with code
in ZODB/ZEO, but we do not consider Durus to be a modification of
ZODB/ZEO.

Durus was developed by the MEMS Exchange software team:

Anton Benard 
David Binger 
Roger Masse 
Neil Schemenauer

Neil initiated work on Durus and made it fast.
