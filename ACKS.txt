Durus was inspired by ZODB and ZEO, the database and client/server
code produced by our friends at Zope, Inc.  Like ZODB, Durus
implements a pickle storage system and manages instances of a
Persistent class in a transactional way.  Like ZEO, Durus supports
access to a shared storage from connections in multiple processes.
Unlike ZODB/ZEO, Durus does not support multi-threaded database
access, access to earlier object versions, or object modification
times.

The PersistentList class of Durus is derived from the python standard
UserList, following the same pattern as the ZODB4 PersistentList
class.

The PersistentDict class of Durus is derived from the python standard
UserDict, following the same pattern as the ZODB4 PersistentMapping
class.

The code of Durus shares some small fragments and some names with code
in ZODB/ZEO, but we do not consider Durus to be a modification of
ZODB/ZEO.

Durus was developed by the MEMS Exchange software team:

Anton Benard 
David Binger 
Roger Masse 
Neil Schemenauer

Neil initiated work on Durus and made it fast.
